# Clopidogrel-Montelukast-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Clopidogrel-Montelukast-DDI studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the clopidogrel model regarding the clopidogrel-montelukast-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied montelukast model has been previously made openly available [[1](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Montelukast-Model/releases/tag/v1.1)]. For further details and documentation please refer to [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/5/915)].

## Version information

PK-Sim Version 9.1.
